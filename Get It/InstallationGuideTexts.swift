This guide will assist you with installing these dependencies.\n\nThe dependencies that we will install (if not already installed) are:\n   - Homebrew\n   - Python 3\n   - YouTube-DL \n   - FFMPEG.\n\n.",

Xcode is a large suite of software development tools and libraries from Apple.\nInstallation of many common Unix-based tools requires the GCC compiler. The Xcode Command Line Tools include a GCC compiler.\n\nTo install the Xcode command line tools, just press the 'Install' button below and follow the guide that will pop up.",

Enter your password when the installer asks for it.\nWhen the installation has finished, you may close the Terminal app.",

It's an open-source command line tool that handles the downloading of our files.\nWe also want to install FFMPEG for post processing of our files (e.g. converting our audio to mp3).\n\nTo install YouTube-DL and FFMPEG, just press the 'Install' button below.",
